## Key Features
Data Wrangling: Extensive cleaning using SQL queries and Power Query to handle nulls and format inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Built-in measures and calculated columns to identify customer trends.

Predictive Modeling: A Random Forest model implemented in Python to classify data points based on historical patterns.

Automation: Streamlined transformations to ensure the dashboard updates accurately with new data.

## Repository Structure
data/: Contains the Customer_Data.csv raw dataset.

sql/: Documented SQL scripts used for initial data preparation.

power_bi/: Power Query transformations and DAX measures.

models/: Python scripts for the Random Forest implementation.

README.md: Project documentation.

## How to Use
SQL Setup: Run the scripts in the sql/ folder on your local environment to structure the data.

Visualization: Open the Power BI documentation to replicate the measures and dashboard layout.

Machine Learning: Execute the Python script to train the Random Forest model on the provided CSV data.
